# Pong-Game-with-CPU-Player-2
## Created by Noah Rosenblatt
Written from scratch in Python 3.11, but inspired by lessons from 100 Days of Code by Angela Yu.

Run the main.py file in order to start the game.

Notable features include a CPU Player 2 that reacts to the player's shot
in a human-like imperfect manner, and a paddle that allows for a certain degree
of directional influence on the ball depending on where the ball hits relative
to the center of the paddle.
